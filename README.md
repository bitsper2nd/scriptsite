# scriptsite
This is a repository that hosts [User Scripts for Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/UserScripts), an Android browser. They might also work on other mobile or desktop browsers, but I only use them on [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/).

### Scripts
Here scripts are sorted by category. See below on how to install them into your browser.

### Credits
This was all made possible thanks xarantolus. Check out his repo to autogenerate [filter lists](https://github.com/xarantolus/filtrite) for Bromite and [userscripts](https://github.com/xarantolus/bromite-userscripts/). And if you really like it give him the star.
